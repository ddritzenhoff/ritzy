```

## Content Structure

- `content/posts/` - Blog posts

## Post Front Matter

```yaml
---

date: 2025-06-17
draft: false
description: "A brief description of your post"
---
```

## LaTeX Support

ritzy includes built-in LaTeX support through MathJax. You can use LaTeX in your posts like this:

Inline math: `$E = mc^2$`

Block math:
```
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$
```

## Adding Images

You can add images to your posts with standard Markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/your-image.png)
```

Or with HTML for more control:

```html
<img src="/images/your-image.png" alt="Alt text" style="max-width: 400px;" />
```

Images in posts are automatically centered and responsive. You can add captions to images by adding an italicized text immediately after the image:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/your-image.png)
*This is an image caption that will be centered below the image*
```

## Adding Posts

You can add a post like this:

`hugo new posts/<post-name>.md`
